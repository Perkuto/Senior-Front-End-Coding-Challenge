# WallE

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Tests

The tests were generate automaticaly with Angular CLI via scaffolding. I did not have the time to add some.
I know, it is important and I would have to learn how to do them using Protractor.
